# ravel
Have problem solving ravelled(jumble/scrambled) words, unravel using ravel.

Why ravel?

  If you by any chance have a good habit(that's what people say about it) of reading newpaper(I read Deccan Herald) everyday you would have come across something called jumble have you ever wondered what the heck is this jumble, its just shuffled letters which forms a meaningful word. On a good day I was able to solve all jumbled/ravelled letters but on some occasions I couldn't. That is when I thought how about a little program to get me out of this enigmatic situation. That's how sperm met ovum and zygote(i.e. In this case we named our baby ravel) was formed.
